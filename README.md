# Terraria-Sports
A sports mod for Terraria

## Items
The sports mods comes alongside a multitude of new items for terraria including balls, bats, and other stuff

### Balls
Many new balls have been added by this mod

#### Baseballs & Softballs

One of the ball types that we have added are baseballs, these are essentially for throwing and will damage enemies, currently we have yet to add bats that will allow you to play baseball.
Softball is essentially the exact same thing as baseball, but we made the softball do less damage, because it has soft in the name.
